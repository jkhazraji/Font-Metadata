Since Android does not provide a method to get font (.ttf, .otf) meta data. I presents this code made with b4a to get around this.
Move the webview files(.html, .ttf, .js) to Files directory And .xml file to objects folder please

Libraries:
fileprovider, 
javaobject, 
json, 
phone, 
reflection, 
stringutils, 
webviewextras, 
webviewsettings, 
xui.
